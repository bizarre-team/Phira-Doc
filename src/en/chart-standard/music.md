# Music File Format

Supported music formats:

- `.mp3`
- `.ogg`
- `.wav`

::: warning Note
1. `mp3` files may have unpredictable latency. It is recommended to use `ogg` files to avoid this issue.
2. `wav` is an uncompressed raw audio format that takes up more space and may cause chart uploads to fail.
