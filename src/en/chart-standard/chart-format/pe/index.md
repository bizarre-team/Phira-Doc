# PE Documentation

PEC (PhiEditor Chart) is a plain‑text chart format. Unlike common formats such as JSON, it requires manually written serialization/deserialization code.  
This document only describes the structure of the PEC format and does not guarantee behavioral accuracy. This format is no longer being updated.
