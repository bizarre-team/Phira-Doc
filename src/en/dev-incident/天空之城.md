# 天空之城 (Castle in the Sky)

This incident occurred at 19:00 on 2024-04-13 (the time when 大鸽子咕咕咕 sent the message in the update discussion group: "Whoever wants to boost their stats can check this out. It got rejected four times but still shows this status; not sure if it's a bug.")

## Incident Details

When a reviewer rejects a chart under poor network conditions, a phenomenon can occur where the chart is "rejected" but not properly trigger the reject action. This situation attracted 14 reviewers to successively participate in the rejection operation for "Castle in the Sky."

The list of reviewers who participated in the rejection is as follows:

> No Approvals  
> 14 Rejections: 超爱吃盐的盐盐, twotthrees233, 右果ary, WinterPT, scylic, 远空星灵, SSuent_, -zerouth-, StR-1, sjfhsjfh, Max3957, Kedmue, Dr.Asriel, Naptie

...Why is sjfhsjfh in there too?

The battle for this chart finally ended when Naptie successfully triggered the rejection operation using the "RunRunRun Brand Private Connection."
But will the battle truly end? Who knows (
