# 6thPecJam

This incident occurred around 00:40 on the early morning of 2024-02-10, which was over half an hour later than the scheduled PecJam submission opening time of 00:00 on 2024-02-10.

> Note: 2024-02-09 was New Year's Eve. Everyone was staying up late, waiting to submit their PecJam entries.

## Incident Details

Seeing everyone in the group chat asking why the PecJam submission channel hadn't opened yet, sjfhsjfh hastily and carelessly modified the Phira backend code in a state of anxiety. The changes were submitted without even performing a compilation check, ultimately forcing Mivik to crawl out of a warm bed to help fix the issue. This was truly a grave offense.
