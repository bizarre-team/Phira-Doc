# v0.6.0 Update Message

This incident occurred at 23:16 on 2024-01-01 (the time when Mivik sent the message "wtf did you do?" in the update discussion group)

Similar to the [Willow catkins in the wind](./长风的柳絮.md) incident, this was a serious consequence of manual database operations. This incident is also referred to as "Willow catkins in the wind 2."

## Incident Details

sjfhsjfh attempted to modify an erroneously released announcement. In a state of panic and haste, improper operations resulted in the content of all messages for all users being changed to the new announcement content (i.e., the v0.6.0 update announcement).

> This incident cost Mivik approximately an entire evening to recover, and all messages from that day were lost.
