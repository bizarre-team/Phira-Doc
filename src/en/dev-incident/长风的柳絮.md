# 长风的柳絮 (Willow catkins in the wind)

This incident occurred at 18:53 on 2023-07-10 (when sjfhsjfh sent in the internal group: “I’m here to profusely apologize”).

## Incident Details

While manually operating the database (using SQL statements) to ban the user "长风的柳絮" (Willow Catkins of Changfeng), sjfhsjfh accidentally sent an unfinished UPDATE statement (without the `WHERE` keyword and without properly setting `SET banned = TRUE`). This resulted in all users' usernames being changed to "长风的柳絮".

> This incident cost Mivik an entire afternoon and evening self-study session to recover (from logs), but did not cause significant data loss.

## Aftermath

There are always two sides to every story. After this incident, Mivik provided the moderation team leader with a convenient and quick ban button to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Unfortunately, sjfhsjfh's jinx-like attribute did not disappear because of this incident, as seen in the [v0.6.0 Update Message](./v0.6.0更新消息.md).
